Compound Engineering Framework for AI Agents
</pre>

## 🌟 Overview 

The Flux framework transforms AI-coder development through **session-based workflows** with **intelligent context priming** and **continuous self-improvement**. Every development session automatically loads the optimal model context and builds institutional knowledge that makes each subsequent session more effective.

[![FLUX Compound Engineering Framework](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c624257-665e-4c8d-98e4-48377857d470)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAAv3mtX__U)

## 🧠 Core Philosophy 

#### 🤖 Intelligent Context Priming
* Automatically provide AI models with precisely the right information from your codebase and documentation, eliminating manual context management.

#### 🎯 Learning-Driven Sessions
* Structure all development work into trackable sessions with clear goals and automatic progress documentation. Each session runs in its own Git branch - the framework handles this automatically.

#### 📈 Continuous Self-Improvement
* Capture problems, solutions, and insights from every session to build a growing knowledge base that prevents repeated mistakes and accelerates future development.

## ✨ Key Features 

- **Smart Context Loading**: Automatically primes AI model context with relevant files and lessons based on session goals
- **Zero Manual Setup**: No need to explain project structure or copy-paste code snippets
- **Session Isolation**: Each session runs in its own Git branch automatically
- **Learning Capture**: Every challenge and solution becomes institutional knowledge
- **Documentation Evolution**: Project understanding improves automatically over time

## 🚀 Quick Start

> *Note: The framework works out-of-the-box with Claude Code but can be easily modified to work with other AI coding agents.*

#### 0. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/carveragents/flux.git
cp -R flux/commands ~/.claude/
```

#### 1. Initialize Your Repo (One-Time Setup)
```bash
/flux:repo:init [repo_desc]
```
*Creates boilerplate files (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/LESSONS.md`), reads your codebase, and generates project documentation automatically*

#### 2. Start with Intelligent Context Priming
```bash
/flux:session:start fix memory leak in data processing
```
*Framework analyzes your goal, loads relevant code and docs, surfaces applicable lessons, and creates an isolated branch `bugfix-memory-leak-data-processing` for development*

#### 3. Develop
*Develop as normal. Let AI generate code. It may encounter problems, solve as normal using human + AI mix.*

#### 4. Update and Capture Progress
```bash
/flux:session:update
```
*Updates session progress, summarizes and captures development flow*

#### 5. End with Knowledge Capture
```bash
/flux:session:end
```
*Updates lessons learned and prepares insights for future sessions*

## 📦 Commands Reference

All commands live under `commands/flux/` and are organized into three groups:

### Repo Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/flux:repo:init [repo_desc]` | One-time setup — creates boilerplate files, reads the codebase, and generates project documentation |

### Session Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/flux:session:start [goal]` | Start a new session with context priming and branch creation |
| `/flux:session:update` | Append a progress update to the active session |
| `/flux:session:end` | End the session with a comprehensive summary and lesson capture |
| `/flux:session:current` | Show the active session's status, duration, and recent updates |
| `/flux:session:list` | List all past and present session files |
| `/flux:session:help` | Show session command help and best practices |

### Git Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/flux:git:commit` | Analyze changes and generate conventional commit messages with emojis; auto-splits large changes into atomic commits |
| `/flux:git:merge-cleanup [target]` | Merge work branch into target (default: main), push to origin, and delete the work branch |
| `/flux:git:merge-retain [target]` | Merge work branch into target (default: main), push to origin, and switch back to the work branch |

Git commands integrate seamlessly with the session workflow but are entirely optional.

## 🔧 Extending beyond Claude Code

All logic lives in the **command contracts** (`commands/flux/{repo,session,git}/*.md`). To adapt:

- Map `allowed tools` and filesystem paths to your agent/runtime.
- Keep the **session file format** stable for portability.
- If your agent can run shell steps, branch creation and `git status` work as-is.

## 📋 Best Practices

- **Specific Goals**: Start sessions with clear, measurable objectives
- **Regular Updates**: Document progress and discoveries as they happen
- **Honest Recording**: Capture what didn't work as well as what did
- **Review Lessons**: Let the framework surface relevant insights from previous work
- **Initialize First**: Run `/flux:repo:init` once per project to set up documentation scaffolding
